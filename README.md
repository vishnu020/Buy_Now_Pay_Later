1. Perform a EDA explanation for the histograms and Corelation matrix in under 10 lines. What can you conclude from them?
marks
2. Do you think data scaling and categorical variables handling is needed in the dataset? Why or Why not?

3. Code and compare results showing at least two classifier models from Logistic regression, GBM(Gradient boosting) or 
AdaBoost. Compare the accuracy results via a confusion matrix and report. Which model would you recommend here? Why?

4. Create a Grid Search for both L1,L2 regularisation using C = [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000] for one of the models you 
recommended. What is your conclusion?â€“

5. Code and using Keras fit at least 3 types of Neural network using Keras Sequential model. Use at least 3 models from below 
options. You can keep batch size as 15 and number of epochs to 100.Why you think your model improved or did not improve?
